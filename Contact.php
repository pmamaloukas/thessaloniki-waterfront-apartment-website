                <p>The Music Hall (Opera) of Thessaloniki as well as the public Sports Center and Swimming Pool "Poseidonio" is within 10 min walking distance. The Folklore Museum is also very close and it is a very interesting destination for tourists intrigued by the city's bygone era. You can reach the city centre and the most famous sights (Alexander the Great's statue, White Tower, Royal Theatre, State Theatre, YMCA, International Fair, Aristotle's Square, Archaelogical Museum, Byzantine Museum) on foot (walking along the waterfront) in 30-40 min or by bike or electric scooter in 15 min. Electric scooters for hire are scattered along the waterfront. You can also hire bikes and carriages with pedals in front of the Sailing Club wich is situated by the sea within 10 min walking distance. </p>
